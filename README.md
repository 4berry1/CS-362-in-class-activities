# CS-362-in-class-activities
This is a few small programs that were designated to write for in class activities.

The files will need to have thier own input for calling the functions as I did not enter any base cases.

So if it doesnt run anything that is because there is no call to the function in the file.

The call to the function will need to be implimented to test the program but tey all work correctly.
